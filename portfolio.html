            <img src="images/portfolio/cypher.jpg" class="projectImage" />
            <p>This was a project I had to do for school. It involved using Java to write a program to encrypt and decrypt 
              Cesear and Bellaso cyphers with a user defined key. The program Used a JavaFX UI for user interactions.</p>

            <h2>Music DataBase</h2>
            <p>This was a project I had completed with a group during my databases class I took last quarter. This project uses a SQL Server database as its
               backend and a javaFX application as its front end. This project kept track of users favorite songs and allowed for users to post and comment on songs for discussion.  </p>

            <h2>Discord Bot</h2>
            <p>This was a personal project I had taken on because I wanted to be able to play music in a discord call with my freinds. 
              I was able to implement the bot using Java and the resources discord provides. I also used the youtube api for java and a library for
               playing audio through the bot. I read lots of documentation to figure out the methods needed to make the bot work and had to do a lot of 
               troubleshooting but in the end, I had a bot I was happy with.
